NESTML is a domain-specific language for neuron and synapse models. These dynamical models can be used in simulations of brain acitivty on several platforms, in particular `NEST Simulator <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.org/>`_. NESTML combines:

- ðŸ¢§ an easy to understand, yet powerful syntax;
- ðŸ¢§ a flexible processing toolchain, written in Python;
- ðŸ¢§ good simulation performance by means of code generation (C++ for NEST Simulator).

To see what NESTML looks like, please see the :doc:`models library <models_library/index>` that contains standard integrate-and-fire varieties to a family of biophysical, Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons, as well as several synaptic plasticity models such as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) variants and third-factor plasticity rules.

NESTML language and toolchain development
=========================================

:doc:`PyNESTML <pynestml_toolchain/index>` is the Python-based toolchain for the NESTML language: it parses the model, invokes ODE-toolbox and performs code generation. Modify PyNESTML to add language elements such as new predefined functions, or to add new target platforms in the form of `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`_ templates.

Internally, differential equations are analyzed by the associated toolchain `ODE-toolbox <https://ode-toolbox.readthedocs.io/>`_, to compute an exact solution if possible or to select an appropriate numeric solver otherwise.
